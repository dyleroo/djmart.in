<h1>WEATHERWATCHER</h1>
<ul>

<li>Users can also add additional locations to those supported by providing the latitude and longitude of the location as well as a label for display on the map</li>
<li>Location and day/time information should be stored in an SQLite database so that the same presentation can be easily generated again in the future</li>
